## 🖥️ 42 Cursus - Minishell

Minishell is a minimalistic shell project designed to mimic the behavior of a Unix shell. This project provides hands-on experience with process creation, pipes, redirections, signals, and command parsing.

It is one of the most complex projects in the 42 curriculum, reinforcing the fundamentals of operating systems and system calls.

## 📌 Project Objectives

✅ Implement a simple shell that executes commands like Bash.

✅ Handle multiple processes using `fork`, `execve`, and `wait`.

✅ Manage standard input/output redirections (`>`, `>>`, `<`).

✅ Support pipes (`|`) for command chaining.

✅ Implement built-in commands such as `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.

✅ Handle environment variables dynamically.

✅ Process user input with a command-line interface.

✅ Manage signals such as `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and `Ctrl+Z`.

✅ Maintain a command history.
